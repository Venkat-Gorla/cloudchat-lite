# CloudChat Lite – Full Stack Messaging App (v1)

> **Full-stack messaging app · React + AWS · Security-first backend design**  
> **Status:** Feature-complete prototype · Backend continued and refined in v2  
> **Scope of this document:** Backend architecture and implementation

CloudChat Lite is a **one-to-one messaging web application** built with **React on the frontend** and a **serverless AWS backend**.

This repository captures **v1 of the system**, with this document intentionally focusing on the **backend implementation**—highlighting strong fundamentals in **authentication, authorization, DynamoDB single-table design, and Infrastructure-as-Code**, while transparently documenting schema limitations that were resolved in **v2**.

## 🚀 Features

- One-to-one conversation model
- Fully asynchronous, stateless backend
- React-based web client (documented separately)
- Cognito-backed authentication with JWT validation
- Secure access-token verification using JWKs (RS256)
- Least-privilege IAM roles per Lambda
- DynamoDB single-table design (messages + metadata)
- CLI-based integration testing utilities
- Serverless Framework–managed infrastructure

## 🏗 Tech Stack

| Layer    | Category       | Technology / Description                   |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend | Framework      | React (SPA)                                |
| Frontend | Communication  | REST-based communication with backend APIs |
| Backend  | Runtime        | Node.js (AWS Lambda)                       |
| Backend  | Infrastructure | AWS + Serverless Framework                 |
| Backend  | Authentication | Amazon Cognito (User Pools, JWT, JWKs)     |
| Backend  | Database       | Amazon DynamoDB                            |
| Backend  | Security       | `jsonwebtoken`, `jwks-rsa`                 |
| Backend  | Deployment     | Infrastructure-as-Code (`serverless.yml`)  |

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Serverless-first design**

  - All compute via AWS Lambda
  - Stateless handlers

- **Authentication boundary**

  - Cognito User Pool for identity
  - JWT access tokens validated per request

- **Data layer**

  - DynamoDB single-table design
  - Messages and conversation metadata co-located
  - Design retained and refined in v2

- **Security posture**

  - RS256 token validation using Cognito JWKs
  - IAM roles scoped per function (least privilege)

## 📚 Key Components

### Authentication & Authorization

- Cognito-based login flow
- Reusable JWT verification library
- Dynamic JWK resolution with caching
- Issuer validation and algorithm enforcement
- Structured auth results shared across Lambdas

### Messaging & Conversations

- Conversations queried via DynamoDB GSI
- User identity derived exclusively from access token
- Metadata rows enriched with sorted, de-duplicated participants

### Admin Model

- Users created by admin only
- End users can authenticate but not self-register
- Suitable for controlled, personal deployments

## 📦 Quick Start (Backend)

> Assumes AWS credentials with permissions to deploy Cognito, DynamoDB, and Lambda.

```bash
cd cloudchat-lite/services/messaging-api
npm install
serverless deploy
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Integration Testing Utilities

Located in `integration-test/`:

- **`ddb-messages-insert.js`**

  - Inserts realistic conversation metadata and message rows
  - Enables repeatable backend testing without frontend

- **`ddb-messages-fetch.js`**

  - CLI utility to query and print conversations/messages
  - Input: Cognito username
  - Validates access patterns and sorting behavior

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build a production-style full-stack messaging app
- Demonstrate secure, real-world Cognito integration
- Explore DynamoDB access patterns for chat workloads
- Apply Infrastructure-as-Code and least-privilege IAM
- Treat schema tradeoffs as explicit learning inputs

## 🔮 Known Limitations (v1) & v2 Fixes

> **These limitations are deliberate learning points and are fully addressed in v2.**

### v1 Limitations

- ❌ **Message sort key uses timestamp**

  - Risk of collisions and overwrites under concurrent writes

- ❌ **Conversation GSI uses**

  - `PK = user_id`
  - `SK = conversation_id`
  - Prevents server-side time-based sorting and pagination
  - Client must fetch all conversations and sort locally

- ❌ Limited scalability for high-volume conversations

### v2 Improvements

- ✅ Improved query patterns and scalability

- ✅ Message sort key uses **ULID**

  - Guarantees uniqueness and preserves time ordering

- ✅ Conversation GSI redesigned as:

  - `PK = user_id`
  - `SK = last_message_timestamp#conversation_id`
  - Enables efficient server-side sorting and pagination
